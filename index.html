            "Much of what I do is inspired by the legacy of my late father. I am a former teacher, scientist, and pharmacy technician who has transitioned into the role of a software architect. With a visionary mindset and a strong sense of creativity, I have the ability to dream big and bring ideas to life. I am passionate about continuous learning, and I find great joy in dedicating hours to study and explore new subjects.
   
            Currently, I am focused on learning French and Spanish, with the goal of expanding my language skills to include Italian, Greek, and ultimately Mandarin."
